alpine-nginx
============

An image for using [nginx][nginx], bundled with Alpine Linux and s6.

**_Yet another container for running nginx?_**

Yes, but this one is built from [smebberson/alpine-base][alpinebase] that contains [s6][s6] for process management. Small, fast and with s6.

_**Aren't you only supposed to run one process per container?**_

Hell no! The following are good examples of when multiple processes within one container might be necessary:

- Automatically updating [nginx][nginx] proxy settings when a down-stream application server (nodejs, php, etc) restarts (and the IP changes).
- Automatically updating [HAProxy][haproxy] configuration to load balance to a group of down-stream application servers.
- Running a logging daemon to centralize log management (i.e. [logentries][logentries], [loggly][loggly], [logstash][logstash]).
- When you need to run a script on application server crash (to tidy something up), as the standard [Docker container restart policies][drsp] won't provide this.

In all of these instances, there is one primary services and secondary support services. When the secondary support services fail, they should be automatically restarted. When the primary service fails, the container itself should restart.

Usage
-----

To use this image include `FROM smebberson/alpine-nginx` at the top of your `Dockerfile`, or simply `docker run -p 80:80 -p 443:443 --name nginx smebberson/alpine-nginx`.

Nginx logs (access and error logs) aren't automatically streamed to stdout. To review the access log, run the following in another terminal window:

```
docker exec -i nginx tail -f /var/run/nginx-access/logs/current
```

Customisation
-------------

This container comes setup as follows:

- s6 will automatically start nginx for you.
- If nginx dies, so will the container.
- A basic nginx configuration and a simple default HTML file.

### HTML content

To alter the HTML content that nginx serves up (add your website files), add the following to your Dockerfile:

```
ADD /path/to/content /usr/html/
```

index.html is the default, but that's easily changed (see below).

### Nginx configuration

A basic nginx configuration is supplied with this image. But it's easy to overwrite:

- Create your own `nginx.conf`.
- In your `Dockerfile`, make sure your `nginx.conf` file is copied to `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`.

**Make sure you start nginx without daemon mode, by including `daemon off;` in your nginx configuration, otherwise the container will constantly exit right after nginx starts.**

### Restarting nginx

If you're running another process to keep track of something down-stream (for example, automatically updating [nginx][nginx] proxy settings when a down-stream application server (nodejs, php, etc) restarts) execute the command `s6-svc -h /etc/services.d/nginx` to send a `SIGHUP` to nginx and have it reload its configuration, launch new worker process(es) using this new configuration, while gracefully shutting down the old worker processes.

### nginx crash

By default, if nginx crashes, the container will stop. This has been configured within `root/etc/services.d/nginx/finish`. This is so the host machine can handle any issues, and automatically restart it (the docker way, `docker run --autorestart`).

If you don't want this to happen, simply replace the `root/etc/services.d/nginx/finish` with a different file in your image. I like to `ln -s /bin/true /root/etc/services.d/nginx/finish` in those instances.

### Nginx configuration

If you need to, you can run a setup script before starting nginx. During your `Dockerfile` build process, copy across a file to `/etc/services.d/nginx/run` with the following (or customise it as required):

```
#!/usr/bin/env sh

if [ -e ./setup ]; then
./setup
fi

# start nginx
exec nginx;
```
